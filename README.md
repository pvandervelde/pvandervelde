I have been working as Software engineer for the last 15 years. Working in a wide range of industries, from emergency services to the cinema industry. I have worked on projects that involved developing software that was shipped to customers, as well as projects that involved delivery to internal development teams.

My main interest is the design and building of an autonomous mobile robot with four wheel independent steering (also known as a swerve drive). The prototype has ROS2 code for [robot description](https://github.com/pvandervelde/zinger_description), the [Gazebo world](https://github.com/pvandervelde/zinger_ignition)
and the [steering controller](https://github.com/pvandervelde/zinger_swerve_controller).
Additionally I have also contributed a significant amount of the ROS code
for the [SCUTTLE robot](https://github.com/scuttlerobot).

My other interest are:

* Autonomous mobile robots
* Robot Operating System
* Electronics
* Computer Aided Design (Rhino3d, Fusion360, AutoCad)
* IOT
* Climbing
* Gardening
* Woodworking
